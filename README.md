    `SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and transactions.currency="INR\r" or transactions.currency="USD\r";`

1. Show total revenue in year 2020 in Chennai

    `SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020
and transactions.market_code="Mark001";`

Data Analysis Using Power BI
============================

I added a new column to the dataset using Power Query in Power BI. The formula used to create the norm_amount column is as follows:

`= Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] ="USD#(cr)" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount], type any)`

This formula checks the currency of each transaction. If the currency is USD or USD#(cr), it multiplies the sales amount by 75 to normalize it to the Indian Rupee (INR). Otherwise, it keeps the sales amount unchanged.
